## Configuration

The Passport Broker service can be configured with custom properties, affecting behavior at runtime. There is an example config file present in this repo:

```
passportBrokerConfig:
  serverProps:
    scheme: http
    publicApiPort: 7000
    adminApiPort: 7001
  serviceInfo:
    id: org.ga4gh.starterkit.passport.broker.custom.test
    name: Passport Broker Custom Config Test Deployment
    description: Passport Broker test deployment using custom configurations
    contactUrl: mailto:test@ga4gh.org
    organization:
      name: GA4GH
      url: https://ga4gh.org
```

This configuration file modifies some fields, but there are many more fields that can be configured.

## YAML config file

The YAML config file must contain a single root property of `drs`, under which all subconfigurations are located:

```
passportBrokerConfig:
  serverProps:
    ...
  databaseProps:
    ...
  serviceInfo:
    ...
  brokerProps:
    ...
```

## serverProps

A valid 'serverProps' configuration may look like the following:

```
serverProps:
    scheme: http
    publicApiPort: 7000
    adminApiPort: 7001
```

Full list of modifiable attributes:
